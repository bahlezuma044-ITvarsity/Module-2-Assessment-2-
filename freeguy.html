                            <h3>FREE GUY</h3>
                           <p>Free Guy is a 2021 American science fiction action comedy film directed by Shawn Levy from a screenplay by Matt Lieberman and Zak Penn, and a story by Lieberman. The film stars Ryan Reynolds (who also produced) as a bank teller who discovers he is actually a non-player character in an open-world video game and decides to become the hero of the story and save his friends from deletion by the game's creator. Jodie Comer, Joe Keery, Lil Rel Howery, and Utkarsh Ambudkar also star..</p>
                           <p>Following a year-long delay because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Free Guy was released theatrically in the United States on August 13, 2021 in RealD 3D, IMAX and Dolby Cinema formats by 20th Century Studios. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the clever concept and compared it favorably as a combination of Ready Player One, The Truman Show, The Matrix and Grand Theft Auto</p>
                           <p>Millie and Guy meet again when she breaks into the Stash, another player's well-protected area that holds evidence of her source code. Guy helps Millie escape the Stash, and Millie recognizes that Guy is becoming sentient and believes that he can help her find her original code within the game world. Keys and Millie realize that Guy's self-awareness came about from artificial intelligence code containing Millie's personal preferences that Keys had included in Life Itself, which in turn had led Guy to develop a romantic interest with Millie. When Millie tells Guy the truth of his situation, Guy breaks off their relationship, telling her that he's in love with her. However, after talking with Buddy about the situation, Guy realizes that there was something more than love in that relationship and gains full sentience. Guy returns to Millie to agree to help before Free City is wiped from Soonami's servers to make way for its sequel, Free City 2, in two days.</p>          
                           <p>Without Millie and Keys's code, Free City 2 is a catastrophic failure at launch, Antwan becomes involved in several media controversies and he is arrested. Keys, Mouser and Millie start a successful new company with the recovered code to release Free Life, bringing Guy, Buddy, Dude and the other Free City NPCs into it. Thanks to Guy, Millie realizes that Keys's code was in fact a love letter to her, and they embrace and kiss.

Meanwhile, in Free Life, Guy reunites with Buddy and they begin to live their own lives without having to follow their original coding from Free City.</p>
